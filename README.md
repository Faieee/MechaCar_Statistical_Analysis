## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Multiple linear regression was carried out to determine the effect of a MechaCar's length, weight, spoiler angle, ground clearence, and presence of AWD on its mpg.

### Analysis 
- Ground clearence (p = 5.21e-08) and vehicle length (p = 2.60e-12) have statistically significant effects on the mpg of MechaCars. The presence of the intercept (p = 5.08e-08) suggests that there are other factors that significantly influence the MechaCars' mpg that are not present in this dataset.
- Since there are multiple non-zero coefficients in the data set, the regression line will have a non-zero slope.
- An R-squared value of 0.71 indicates that the regression model has a strong correlation with the MechaCar data.
